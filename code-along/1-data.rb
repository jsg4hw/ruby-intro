# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# # Numbers
# puts 5
# #to output --> puts
# puts 5+2
# puts 5-2
# puts 5*2
# puts 5/2 #will return an integer because it expects that
# puts 5%2 #will return the remainder

# puts 5.0/2.0 #need to insert number as float
# puts 5.0/2 #one more precise data type will prompt it to return the more precise data type

# # Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 * 2 + 1
# puts 5 * (2 + 1) #order of operations applies

# Strings

puts "test"
